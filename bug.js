```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature.  However, if the `from` and `to` colors are not compatible (e.g., drastically different hues and saturations), it might create a visually jarring or unexpected gradient.  This is not technically an error, but rather an unexpected visual outcome.

Another issue could be that the gradient might look different across different browsers or devices due to minor variations in how gradient rendering is handled.
