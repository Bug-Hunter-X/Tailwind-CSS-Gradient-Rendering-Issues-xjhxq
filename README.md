# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where the resulting visual effect might be unexpected due to incompatible color choices or slight browser inconsistencies in gradient rendering.

## Bug Description

When using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-*` utility classes, the generated gradient may appear visually jarring or unexpected depending on the chosen colors.  Subtle differences in color rendering across different browsers can further exacerbate this.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains code exhibiting this issue.  Observe the gradient's appearance in different browsers and compare it to your expectations.

## Solution

The `solution.js` provides some suggestions to mitigate these issues:

- Carefully choose colors that transition smoothly to avoid jarring effects.
- Consider using color palettes that are designed to work well together.
- For critical applications, test gradient rendering across a wide range of browsers and devices to ensure consistency.
